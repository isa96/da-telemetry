4: Cyber Security
Identify the security issue which led to a leak of private company information.

# Background Information
A big news publication has revealed sensitive private information of Daikibo Industrials' – a production problem has caused their assembly lines to stop, threatening the smooth operation of supply chains relying on Daikibo’s products. The client suspects the security of their new status board may have been breached.

# Task Brief
In this task you will be joining our Cyber Security team. Your job is to:

	1. Determine if the alleged breach could have happened from an attacker on the Internet, directly (no access to Daikibo's VPN).
		Hint: go back to the scope requirements of the status dashboard (previous task) and look for the answer there
	2. Inspect a web_requests.log file (listing only data from a period when the alleged attack has to have happened):
		Try to spot suspicious requests
			Hint: in the Resources section you can find a diagram example on how to read the logs file
			Hint: Look for longer sequences of user requests
			Hint: notice the order of request from Login ? to requests for the dashboard page's resources (styles, scripts, images, etc.) ? to api requests for the actual statuses of the machines
			Hint: How would you recognize if an automated request to the API happens at an exact interval of time (assume no such functionality is available in the dashboard)
 
		If you've identified such requests - make sure to write down the id of the user (it's part of the requests)

Here is how the web_requests.log file is structured:

	There is a sequence of blocks of text, divided by an empty line
	Each block represents the activity of a unique IP address (no 2 blocks have the same IP)
	The block starts with the IP address followed by a table of the requests made to Daikibo's telemetry dashboard by the device with this IP address, sorted by time
	The IP addresses are from the internal Daikibo's network and are static
	1 block can represent 1 or multiple browsing sessions
	Sessions made on different dates require new login
	There is no continuous polling/pushing of data between client & server - the users need to refresh the page to get the latest
	Hint: For an easier visual inspection, open up the file in a code editor like Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code, expand the window to the full width of your screen and decrease font size until you no text breaks on new line

When you believe you have answered the 2 questions above - submit the task by taking a quick quiz to check your discoveries. Start the quiz by clicking 'Click here to start the task' in section 5 below. Good luck!
