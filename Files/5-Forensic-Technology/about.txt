5: Forensic Technology
Help your team to complete an investigation into unfair pay.

# Background Information
After a worrisome number of internal complaints on gender inequality (in terms of pay), Daikibo Industrials wants us to help them investigate.

The Forensic Tech team has built an algorithm to quantify “level of gender pay equality” for most/all job roles within the company, in all company locations. Our Forensics lead thinks it will be a great welcoming task for you to finish the job.

# Task Brief
We have processed all data on employee compensation and we've generated an excel file (Equality Table.xlsx, available in the Resources) containing 3 columns:

	1. Factory
	2. Job Role
	3. Equality Score (integer; ranging between -100 and +100; 0 is ideal)

Here is your final task:

	Create a 4th column (Equality class), classifying the equality score in those 3 types:
		Fair (+-10)
		Unfair (<-10 AND >10)
		Highly Discriminative (<-20 AND >20)

Examples:

	6 ? Fair
	-9 ? Unfair
	-30 ? Highly Discriminative

Please find the Equality Table you need to edit from the task's Resources. When you are done - upload the edited version of the file.
