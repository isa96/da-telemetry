1: Coding
Create an algorithm to unify 2 different data models.

# Background Information
We have signed a new account - Daikibo Industrials, a global leader in the manufacturing of heavy machinery, founded and headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. They needed assistance with a variety of problems and were impressed to find out Deloitte could help in all verticals.

Daikibo is in the process of integrating IIoT (Industrial Internet-of-Things) devices to monitor, measure and analyze their manufacturing processes. Half of their infrastructure uses devices streaming telemetry data in one format, and the other half - in another. They need your help to combine the two.

# Task Brief
Take the following steps to complete the task:

1. Create an account at repl.it.
2. Fork this project (https://replit.com/@NikolayTsenkov/Task1) into your workspace.
	After navigating to the project - find the Fork button on the page and press it.
3. Get acquainted with the 2 data formats by exploring the files (hint: it's the same message, represented in 2 different formats):
	data-1.json
	data-2.json
4. Explore the target unified format by looking at the file data-result.json.
5. Complete the solution located in the file main.py.
	The project is setup in a way to test your solution automatically as you run it.

	Find the 2 functions in need of implementation and finish them (look for comment lines starting with "IMPLEMENT:").

	Use repl.it to run your project and test your solution (look for a big Run button, currently located at the top).

	Don't mind the red color of the console output and the message on failed repl process when you run the project - the important thing is to see no failures in the tests.

		Successful tests produce output looking similar to this
		...
		----------------------------------------------------------------------
		Ran 3 tests in 0.001s

		OK
		repl process died unexpectedly: 
	Please use comments in main.py, if you need to leave notes on your solution.

	Hint: notice the timestamps of the 2 telemetry formats are different, but the target format is exactly like one of them (milliseconds). You will need to convert the other format (ISO) to it. Check the resources section for a link to a SO post that can help.

6. Submit the url to your solution (your public repl project) to finish the task.
	to get the url, just open the project in repl.it and copy the content of your browser's address bar/url.
